# JBPT-Final_Project
JBPT Group - Jeff, Benjamin, Prescott, Tin We want to create an app called TuneTogether which can share songs, albums, or playlists with our group of friends.

Problem? ● People on Spotify can't see their friends' music that use apple music & vice versa. ● Just listening to music is boring, the app can provide more features like singing together, giving comments, or ranking the songs.

Solution? ● Creating a social media platform that links music applications so everyone can see what their peers are listening to no matter the music platform. ● Sing together in real time (live). ● Chat box for song discussion.

Monetization? ● If you are using the free version, you would get ad pop ups. However, if you pay a small fee of 5.99 a month you get an ad free experience. ● Pay to listen to music offline. ● .99 cent for doing karaoke with friends in real time.
